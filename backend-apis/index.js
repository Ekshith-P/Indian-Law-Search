Supreme Court of India
Citation: (1973) 4 SCC 225
Date: April 24, 1973

FULL JUDGMENT TEXT:

This landmark case, heard by a 13-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India, is one of the most significant constitutional cases in Indian legal history. The case addressed fundamental questions about the scope of Parliament's power to amend the Constitution and the relationship between fundamental rights and constitutional amendments.

BACKGROUND:
The petitioner, Kesavananda Bharati, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963, which sought to acquire his property. The case raised broader constitutional issues about the extent of Parliament's amending power under Article 368 of the Constitution.

KEY ISSUES:
1. Whether Parliament has unlimited power to amend the Constitution
2. Whether fundamental rights can be abrogated through constitutional amendments
3. The scope and limitations of Article 368
4. The relationship between fundamental rights and directive principles

HELD:
The Supreme Court, by a majority of 7:6, held that:

1. Parliament has the power to amend any part of the Constitution, including fundamental rights
2. However, this power is not unlimited and cannot alter the "basic structure" of the Constitution
3. The basic structure includes:
   - Supremacy of the Constitution
   - Republican and democratic form of government
   - Secular character of the Constitution
   - Separation of powers between legislature, executive, and judiciary
   - Federal character of the Constitution
   - Unity and integrity of the nation
   - Welfare state and social justice
   - Judicial review
   - Freedom and dignity of the individual

4. Fundamental rights are part of the basic structure and cannot be completely abrogated
5. The 24th, 25th, and 29th Constitutional Amendments were upheld as valid

SIGNIFICANCE:
This judgment established the "Basic Structure Doctrine," which has since been used to strike down constitutional amendments that violate the basic structure. It has been applied in numerous subsequent cases to protect the core values of the Indian Constitution.

The judgment represents a delicate balance between parliamentary sovereignty and constitutional supremacy, ensuring that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential character and values.

This case continues to be the foundation of constitutional law in India and has influenced constitutional jurisprudence worldwide.`,

Supreme Court of India
Citation: (1981) 1 SCC 722
Date: January 9, 1981

FULL JUDGMENT TEXT:

This case is a landmark judgment that significantly expanded the scope of Article 12 of the Indian Constitution, which defines "State" for the purposes of Part III (Fundamental Rights).

BACKGROUND:
The case arose from a challenge to the admission process of the Regional Engineering College, Srinagar. The petitioners alleged that the admission process violated their fundamental rights under Articles 14 and 15.

KEY ISSUES:
1. Whether the Regional Engineering College, Srinagar, is a "State" within the meaning of Article 12
2. Whether the admission process violated fundamental rights
3. The scope and interpretation of Article 12

HELD:
The Supreme Court held that:

1. The Regional Engineering College, Srinagar, is a "State" within the meaning of Article 12 because:
   - It is substantially financed by the Government
   - It performs public functions (education)
   - It is under deep and pervasive control of the Government
   - It is an instrumentality of the State

2. The admission process violated Article 14 (Right to Equality) because:
   - It was arbitrary and lacked objective criteria
   - It gave unfettered discretion to the authorities
   - It was not based on merit

3. The Court laid down the following tests to determine if a body is a "State":
   - Whether the entire share capital is held by the Government
   - Whether it enjoys monopoly status conferred by the State
   - Whether it performs functions of public importance
   - Whether it is under deep and pervasive control of the Government
   - Whether it is substantially financed by the Government

SIGNIFICANCE:
This judgment expanded the definition of "State" under Article 12 to include bodies that:
- Perform public functions
- Are substantially financed by the Government
- Are under deep and pervasive control of the Government
- Are instrumentalities of the State

The case has been widely cited in subsequent judgments and has helped in bringing various private bodies performing public functions within the ambit of fundamental rights.

This expansion of Article 12 has been crucial in ensuring that fundamental rights are not only protected against State action but also against actions of bodies that are effectively State instrumentalities.`,

Date: July 2, 2014

FULL JUDGMENT TEXT:

This landmark judgment addresses the misuse of Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and provides important guidelines for arrest procedures and anticipatory bail.

BACKGROUND:
The petitioner, Arnesh Kumar, was accused under Section 498A IPC (cruelty by husband or relatives of husband) and sought anticipatory bail. The case highlighted the widespread misuse of Section 498A and the need for proper arrest procedures.

KEY ISSUES:
1. Whether arrest should be automatic in cases under Section 498A IPC
2. The scope and application of anticipatory bail
3. Guidelines for police arrest procedures
4. Protection against arbitrary arrests

HELD:
The Supreme Court held that:

1. Arrest should not be made in a routine manner in cases under Section 498A IPC
2. The police must follow the guidelines laid down in Section 41 CrPC before making arrests
3. The following factors should be considered before arrest:
   - Whether the accused is likely to abscond
   - Whether the accused is likely to tamper with evidence
   - Whether the accused is likely to intimidate witnesses
   - Whether the arrest is necessary for proper investigation

4. The Court issued the following guidelines:
   - Police officers should not automatically arrest when a case under Section 498A is registered
   - They should first satisfy themselves about the necessity for arrest
   - A checklist should be prepared before making arrests
   - The reasons for arrest should be recorded in writing

5. The Court also directed that:
   - A copy of the checklist should be furnished to the Magistrate
   - The Magistrate should not authorize detention without recording reasons
   - The decision not to arrest should also be communicated to the Magistrate

SIGNIFICANCE:
This judgment has been crucial in:
- Preventing arbitrary arrests under Section 498A IPC
- Establishing proper arrest procedures
- Protecting the rights of accused persons
- Reducing the misuse of criminal law

The guidelines laid down in this case have been applied to other cases and have helped in ensuring that arrest is not used as a tool of harassment.

This judgment represents an important step in balancing the rights of victims with the rights of accused persons and ensuring that criminal law is not misused.`,

Date: September 6, 2018

FULL JUDGMENT TEXT:

This landmark judgment decriminalized homosexuality in India and recognized the fundamental rights of the LGBTQ+ community.

BACKGROUND:
The case challenged the constitutional validity of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalized consensual same-sex relationships. The petitioners argued that this provision violated fundamental rights.

KEY ISSUES:
1. Whether Section 377 IPC violates fundamental rights
2. The scope of right to privacy under Article 21
3. The right to equality under Article 14
4. The right to dignity and personal liberty

2. The provision violates:
   - Article 14 (Right to Equality)
   - Article 15 (Prohibition of Discrimination)
   - Article 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty)

3. The Court recognized that:
   - Sexual orientation is an innate characteristic
   - LGBTQ+ individuals have the right to live with dignity
   - Privacy includes the right to make intimate choices
   - Discrimination based on sexual orientation is unconstitutional

4. The Court emphasized that:
   - Constitutional morality must prevail over social morality
   - Individual autonomy and dignity are fundamental
   - The State cannot interfere in consensual private relationships
   - LGBTQ+ individuals are entitled to equal protection of law

5. The Court directed that:
   - LGBTQ+ individuals should not face discrimination
   - They should have access to healthcare and other services
   - The State should take steps to eliminate stigma and discrimination

SIGNIFICANCE:
This judgment has been transformative in:
- Recognizing LGBTQ+ rights as fundamental rights
- Expanding the scope of right to privacy
- Promoting equality and non-discrimination
- Advancing human rights in India

The judgment has influenced social attitudes and has been cited in subsequent cases involving LGBTQ+ rights and privacy.

This case represents a significant step towards a more inclusive and equal society.`,
