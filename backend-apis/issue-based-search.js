ARNESH KUMAR ... APPELLANT
VERSUS
STATE OF BIHAR & ANR. ... RESPONDENTS

J U D G M E N T

CHANDRAMAULI KR. PRASAD, J.

This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 4th of February, 2014 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Patna in Criminal Miscellaneous No. 35668 of 2013 whereby and whereunder it has rejected the prayer for anticipatory bail made by the appellant under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The appellant is apprehending his arrest in a case under Sections 498-A of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.

The main question which falls for consideration in this appeal is as to whether the accused is entitled to anticipatory bail when the allegations against him are under Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.

The law in this regard has been well settled by this Court in a catena of decisions. In the case of Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre v. State of Maharashtra and others, (2011) 1 SCC 694, this Court has observed that the power under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is to be exercised sparingly and in exceptional cases only.

The object of Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is to prevent the accused from being detained in custody for some time and thereby losing his job or business. The power under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is to be exercised only in exceptional cases where it appears that the accused has been falsely implicated.

In the present case, the allegations against the appellant are under Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. These are serious allegations and the appellant has not been able to show any exceptional circumstances which would entitle him to anticipatory bail.

In view of the above, we find no merit in this appeal and the same is accordingly dismissed.

However, we make it clear that the dismissal of this appeal shall not preclude the appellant from applying for regular bail under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Ordered accordingly.
